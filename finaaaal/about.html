                <h3>Our Story</h3>
                <p> The School of Nursing was founded in 1909 as the nation’s first continuously operated university-based school of nursing. In 1909 there were 1,129 schools of nursing in the country, all located within hospitals. Hospital-based nursing education was the accepted norm until the middle of the twentieth century.

                    The NEW INSTITUTE OF NURSING EDUCATION for Nurses (as it was known until 1920) was created largely due to the efforts of Dr. Richard Olding Beard, a professor of physiology in the  NEW INSTITUTE OF NURSING EDUCATION who recognized the value of nursing and believed in professional education for women.
                    
                    Initially, the school offered a three-year program in which four students were enrolled the first year. In 1919, a five-year program leading to a baccalaureate degree in nursing began. The shorter non-degree program continued until 1947.
                    
                    A comprehensive summary of the School of Nursing’s history is chronicled in Leading the Way, The School of Nursing 1909 to 2009 (written by Laurie K. Glass) which was commissioned to commemorate the school’s first 100 years. This and other historical materials can be obtained through the Alumni Society’s Heritage Committee. </p>
